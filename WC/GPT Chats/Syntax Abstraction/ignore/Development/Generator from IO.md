
Read the csv example and the example table output and discuss an development approach or write a file tree that would describe the objects or functions that could be used to create the raw output.

To generate the raw output from the CSV file, we can follow a modular approach where each part of the table is generated by a separate function. This will make the code easier to maintain and extend. Here's a high-level overview of the file structure and the functions that could be used:

```text
.
├── main.py
├── table_generator.py
│   ├── generate_table_index()
│   ├── generate_settings()
│   ├── generate_section_title()
│   ├── generate_base_size()
│   ├── generate_question()
│   ├── generate_table_format()
│   └── generate_raw_output()
└── csv_reader.py
    └── read_csv()
```

- main.py: This is the entry point of the application. It uses the functions from table_generator.py and csv_reader.py to generate the raw output.

- table_generator.py: This file contains functions for generating each part of the table. Each function takes the necessary data as input and returns a string that represents that part of the table.

- csv_reader.py: This file contains a function for reading the CSV file. The read_csv() function returns a data structure that contains all the necessary data for generating the table.

Here's a brief description of what each function could do:

- generate_table_index(): Generates the table index (e.g., "T1^").
- generate_settings(): Generates the settings line (e.g., "OR,OB,OS,S1,S2,O%,OI").
- generate_section_title(): Generates the section title (e.g., "Product").
- generate_base_size(): Generates the base size (e.g., "Total ^TN^0").
- generate_question(): Generates the question line (e.g., "Q1. Overall Liking").
- generate_table_format(): Generates the table format lines based on the question type and scale.
- generate_raw_output(): Combines all the above parts to generate the complete raw output.

- read_csv(): Reads the CSV file and returns a data structure that contains all the necessary data for generating the table.

This is a high-level approach and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
