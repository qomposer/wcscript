title: "Prompt: Language Spec"
---

## Language Specification

We are writing a language specification for WCScript - a domain specific language used to generate crosstables for consumer market research survey questions.

We have multiple objectives.

- **Describe the syntax**

- **Map inputs to outputs**

- **Refine abstraction**

## Software Development

We are in the very early stages of developing software that will create the tables. The software will eventually be written in Python.

Read the `Abstraction-Example.md` and describe the syntax. Also describe the syntax abstraction. We need to determine if there is a more efficient way to abstract out the syntax. Ignore everything in the `ignore` file.
